# What is all this about?

My lofty goal is to show you how to use a tool that will increase the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of your research. To do this we are going to attempt some _live coding_. I'll start by doing some talking and demoing, then I'll give you time to work on your own document. I'll keep both windows open throughout the presentation so you can see how the .Rmd file becomes the .pdf file when we knit it. 

When we are about to start Section 2, I'll share with you a copy of this document you see me working on. As the presentation progresses, we will fill in the blanks together, complete activities, and run the code, so you'll get an opportunity to practice the strategies and ideas I'm presenting ... and don't worry, we'll get errors too!

For now just open RStudio and hang tight.

R is a very popular scripting language with a strong statistical foundation. RStudio is a popular IDE for R. RMarkdown is the RStudio implementation of Markdown. Markdown down is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. An RMarkdown document contains text and code together. You can use RMarkdown to minimally format the prose of your manuscript. The code will become tables, plots, trees and other artifacts that you'll want in your document. 

## Anatomy of an RMarkdown document

![rmarkdown.document](images/rmarkdown_document.png){width=90%}

There are three distinct parts of your document

1. the YAML header
1. the prose
1. the code
    a. inline code
    a.  fenced code or code _chunks_


## The YAML header

It is at the very top of the document. The basic syntax of YAML is to use key-value pairs in the format `key: value`. It contains meta data for our document. Things like author, title, type of document output, date the document was created, date it was last updated, bib file, and csl file, and a lot more.

If you wanna learn more: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-overview.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-overview.html)

## The prose

We'll take a few minutes to explore formatting with RMarkdown. You can do quite a few things natively with RMarkdown. Things like _italics_, **bold face**, superscripts x^2^, subscripts H~2~O, and ~~strike through~~.

You also can include LaTeX formulas $sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 = 1$ 

You can give your document structure by creating sections with headers. A top-level header starts with a single hashtag, second level with 2 hashtags, all the way to 6 levels deep. The RStudio IDE makes easy navigating a document with a hierarchical structure by pressing the `Outline` button.

You can also do footnotes^[like this], insert images, and [hyperlinks](https://www.glossa-journal.org/). 

Things you can't do: underline your text. 

Things you technically can do, but it is so cumbersome you shouldn't: tables

For things like images, tables, and plots. We will rely on RMarkdown to do the heavy lifting because it offers greater control over the output and makes reproducibility easier. 

For things like glosses and trees we will use LaTeX environments inside a code chunk.

## The code

There are two ways to include code in your document. One is _inline_ code; the other one is code _chunks._ Inline code appears within a sentence. It is convenient way to include data that is likely to change within your prose. 

For instance, you might be describing you data and say ... "there are **this many participants** in the dataset." In the past, you'd have to know the number and type it out. If there are changes to the data, like more people answered your survey, or observations needed to be discarded, you would have to manually update your number throughout your document. 

A better option would be to ask R to check the value every time you need it. That way if there are changes in the data, those changes will be automatically reflected in your prose. 

You add inline code using back ticks, like so: 

"there are `r native_part + nnative_part` participants presented in the dataset."

This will evaluate the expression every time you render your document, so that now the within the scope of the document, anytime there is a change to `native_part` or `nnative_part`, their sum will reflect that change.

A code chunk functions similarly. They just take three back ticks and they can contain as many lines of code as you want. You still need to specify the language the code chunk uses inside the curly brackets. This code chunk below loads the libraries we will use throughout the document.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
library(bookdown)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

```

<!-- talk about running individual chunks, knit and check the pdf. Do we like this? -->

Something cool about your code chunks is that you can run them individually before you knit your entire document. That makes debugging easier!

## Code chunk options

You can set different settings for your code chunks. You can check an exhaustive list of chunk options by visiting [https://yihui.org/knitr/options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)

If you know that most of your chunks need to behave the same way, you can set global chunk options by running this inside a code chunk at the start of your document. For instance, I usually want the output of my chunks to be part of the document, but I rarely want the actual code to be included in the manuscript. 

`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,`  
                      `include = TRUE,`  
                      `message = FALSE,`  
                      `warning = FALSE)`  
                      
<!-- Change the global chunk options now. Re-knit and check the rendered document -->

## What is happening under the hood

RMarkdown generates a new file that contains selected text and the output of the code. The new file can be a finished _PDF_, _web page_, _MS Word_ document, _slide show_, _notebook_, _handout_, _book_, _dashboard_, _package vignette_ or many others.

```{r, out.width="6in"}
include_graphics("images/how_it_works.png")
```

When you press `Knit`, R Markdown feeds the `.Rmd` file to `knitr`, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (`.md`) document which includes the prose and the output from the code.The markdown file generated by `knitr` is then processed by `pandoc` which is responsible for creating the finished format. This may sound complicated, but `RMarkdown` makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single render function that is invoked every time you press `Knit`.

## Read the data in

We will use a toy data set that I created. I wasn't sure what kind of data I was going to use. I didn't want to play favorites, so today we will work with data related to cooking eggs to perfection because, as you know, eggs are the meal of choice for grad students 'cause they are cheap!


```{r}

beds <- read_csv(file="data/beds.csv") %>% 
    filter(grad_st != 8)

```

## Become familiar with the data

There are tons of ways to explore data in R. Not the point of the workshop today, but more as a motivation for creating tables. What do we think of the way this information is presented?  

```{r, echo = TRUE}

glimpse(beds)

```

### Exercise - inline code

Write a descriptive sentence of the data you just read in that indicates the number of observations in the dataset using the inline code syntax. Hint: the R function you need to include in your code is `nrow()`. This function takes an `R` object as its argument. (2 minutes to work on your own and ask questions)

In this data set the numbers of observations is `r nrow(beds)`.

## Tables

I'm sure you recognize this scenario: you have you data stored somewhere, and you need to display part of your data in a table as part of your analysis. You probably only need part of the data, perhaps you need some summary statistics, and you definitely don't need 16 decimal places. Having your data in `R` streamlines that process.

There are quite a few packages that let you make great looking tables out of your data. I prefer `kableExtra` because it seems to produce the most stable pdfs. You can learn more about `kable` and `kableExtra` here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html

For our "analysis", we want a table that shows the mean cooking time for hard boiled eggs across the types of shell and the types of stove used.

```{r, fancy-table}
beds %>% select(shell, stove, hardboil) %>% 
    group_by(shell, stove) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hb = mean(hardboil)) %>% 
#kable()  
  kable(format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        digits = 2, 
        caption = "Fancy Table") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped",
                                  font_size = 10,
                                  "H"
                                  )) 
```

### Exercise - tables

Suppose you want to recreate the equivalent table **but** for the `softboil` eggs variable. Go ahead and create a new code chunk and make the necessary changes to create that table. To create a new code chunk you can use `Code -> Insert Chunk` from the `Menu`. (3 minutes to work on your own and ask questions)


```{r, fancy-table-2}
beds %>% select(shell, stove, softboil) %>% 
    group_by(shell, stove) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hb = mean(softboil)) %>% 
#kable()  
  kable(format = "latex",
        booktabs = TRUE,
        digits = 2, 
        caption = "Fancy Table") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped",
                                  font_size = 10,
                                  "H"
                                  )) 
```

## Images 

You probably noticed that I inserted an image earlier using `Markdown` syntax. For images, I prefer to use `include_graphics()` from the `knitr` package because it gives me greater controls. Notice all the chunk options.

```{r, fancy-image, out.width="3in", fig.align='right', fig.cap="Fancy Image"}
include_graphics(path = "images/rmarkdown_document.png")
```
## Plots from the data

Let me guess the workflow you likely use:

1. you kept your data in Excel.
1. you subset by hand the part of the data you needed to create your plot and you moved it to a different sheet in your Excel workbook.  
1. you created the plot you needed.
1. you exported the plot to a .png or .jpeg format and named it accordingly
1. you went to Word and imported the plot, placed it manually where you wanted it, and tweaked until it looks just so.

That is a fine workflow to follow. Unless you have to redo the plot. 

Let's create a plot that shows the distribution of observations for the variable `hardboil`. 

```{r, fancy-plot, fig.cap="Fancy plot", out.width="6in", fig.align='center', fig.pos="H"}
beds |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = hardboil)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "white", color = "gray")
```

### Exercise - plots 

Suppose you want to create a plot that shows how many observation each of the grad students recorded. You also want those responses in a bar plot. Hint: you only need to work with one variable and the geom that you need to use is `geom_bar()`. (5 minutes)

```{r, fancy-plot-2, fig.cap="Fancy plot", out.width="6in", fig.align='center', fig.pos="H"}
beds |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = grad_st)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Changes in the data? 

Suppose you find out one of your grad students was involved in a evil plot with Reviewer #2 to thwart your research by introducing faulty data! Grad student #8 used the wrong equipment to measure cooking times! 

Fortunately all you have to do is discard all the observations done by grad student #8 right after you read your data and re-knit your document!!!

You can do this by piping the `read_csv()` statement into this filter statement right after you read it in, like so:

`read_cvs("data/beds.csv") %>% filter(grad_st != 8)`

## Cross referencing artifacts throughout your document. 

To be able to cross reference your figures, plots, and tables, you'll need to meet these criteria:

a. a special kind of output from the `bookdown` package needs to be specified in the YAML header. Careful with the indentation! Don't include the backticks!  
`bookdown::pdf_document2: default`
a. the chunks that produce the output you want to cross reference need to be labeled. The label cannot contain underscores, dashes are okay tho!
a. tables need to include a `caption = "caption_for_my table"` argument in the `kable()` call.
a. plots and figures need to include a `fig.cap = "caption_for _my_figure"` in the chunk option
a. to reference the artifacts, use the following syntax
    - for tables: `\@ref(tab:caption)`
    - for plots and figures: `\@ref(fig:caption)`
    
So far we have managed to create tables directly from the data that has been loaded into R, see Table \@ref(tab:fancy-table). Images can also be included into R with the function `include_graphics()`, see Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-image). Lastly, we learn to include plots generated directly from the loaded data as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-plot).

### Exercise - cross-referencing

Make changes to the table and the plot you created in the exercises above so you can cross-reference them in a paragraph. (3 minutes)

We created table number \@ref(tab:fancy-table-2) and a plot number \@ref(fig:fancy-plot-2)

## Citations

This is one of my favorites things about using RMarkdown. Imagine that you have to submit the same manuscript to various places. Each of these places is asking you to follow a different citation style ...

If you do your document with RMarkdown, you can leave everything the same and just change the .csl file in your YAML that manages how the citations are rendered! It's serious magic. 

There is a huge repo of .csl files maintained by Zotero at https://www.zotero.org/styles. 

For this workshop we will work with a .csl I customized. We will also need a .bib file containing the actual bibliographical information we need. These files need to live in the same project folder. We specify those two pieces of information in the YAML header like so:

  - bibliography: minimal.bib
  - csl: lares.csl

Once that is done, we can include citations anywhere in the prose with the syntax `@unique_identifier`. 

For instance, adding `@Abramson1973` becomes 

> @Abramson1973 finds that VOT of Spanish /ptk/ and English /ptk/ do not overlap.

We have other options for formatting references:

  - Author inside parentheses, `[@Hualde2015]` -> [@Hualde2015]
  - Just the year, `[-@Jackendoff1972]` -> [-@Jackendoff1972]
  - Include a page number, `[@Pierrehumbert1980, :15]` -> [@Pierrehumbert1980, :15]

`Kniter` will automatically create the bibliography at the end of your document. It may be a good idea to include a section at the end of your document and name it `# References`.

# Adding LaTeX flair to your document

Something you probably have noticed is that your RMarkdown document limits a bit the way your manuscript is rendered. You have no control over double or single line spacing or indentations. We have no way to include glosses and syntactic trees natively. To address those details, we are going to bring in some LaTeX sorcery by including the following lines in the YAML header. 

These lines make sure that those LaTeX packages are available within your RMarkdown document when you add them to your YAML header. Don't forget to remove the back ticks.

`header-includes:`  
`- \usepackage{graphicx} %images`  
`- \usepackage{float} %captions`  
`- \usepackage{longtable} %table across pages`  
`- \usepackage{gb4e} \noautomath %glosses`  
`- \usepackage{ragged2e} %text `  
`- \usepackage{setspace}\doublespacing `  
`- \usepackage{indentfirst} `  
`- \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` 
`- \usepackage[linguistics]{forest}`

Let's re-knit the document. Do you notice something new?

## Sentence examples 

To create sentence examples, we rely on the LaTeX package `gb4e`. We will write LaTeX code inside a code chunk. Notice the elements of the `{exe}` environment needed to create a sentence example. 

`\begin{exe}` <- starts the example environment  
`	\ex\label`{unique-label} <- for cross referencing  
	**The sentence goes here**  
`\end{exe}` <- closes the environment  

--- 

```{=tex}
\begin{exe}
	\ex\label{unique-label}
  This is a sentence.
\end{exe}
```

RMarkdown lets you reference sentences created within a `exe` environment **if** they have a label. The syntax is similar to what we did for tables and plots, but not quite the same: `\ref{unique-label}`. 

For example, as seen in (\ref{unique-label}), RMarkdown will take care of your example numbering and it will be dynamic. Meaning that if you need to insert a new example before this one, it will get renumbered to (2).

You know glossing is a pain. How much time have you spent aligning each word with its corresponding gloss? If you have examples that require glosses or multiple instances of one example, you'll need to create a subenvironment with `{xlist}` within the parent `{exe}` environment, like so:

`\begin{xlist}` % subenvironment (1.a)  
`		\ex\label{yet-another-label-a}`  
`		\gll`  target sentence `\\`  
          glossed sentence `\\`  
`		\trans` free translation  
`\end{xlist}`  

---

```{=tex}
\begin{exe} % sets up the top-level example environment (2) 
	\ex\label{another-label}

	\begin{xlist} % subenvironment (2.a)

		\ex\label{another-label-a}
		\gll sacar la pata del barro \\
		{take out} the leg {from the} mud \\
		\trans lit: 'take out the leg from the mud. idm: help somebody 

		\ex\label{another-label-b} % subenvironment (2.b)
		\gll sacar las castañas del fuego \\
		{take out} the chestnuts {from the} fire\\
		\trans lit: pull the chestnust from the fire. idm: help somebody

	\end{xlist} % end first embedding

\end{exe}
```

This gives us more granular control of the example sentences. For instance, (\ref{another-label-b}) is an idiom commonly used in Venezuela.  

### Glosses exercise

Make a copy of the chunk above and add your favorite idiom as a third example. Write a sentence cross referencing the example you wrote indicating why it is your favorite idiom. 

```{=tex}
\begin{exe} % sets up the top-level example environment (2) 
	\ex\label{yet-another-label}

	\begin{xlist} % subenvironment (2.a)

		\ex\label{yet-another-label-a}
		\gll sacar la pata del barro \\
		{take out} the leg {from the} mud \\
		\trans lit: 'take out the leg from the mud. idm: help somebody 

		\ex\label{yet-another-label-b} % subenvironment (2.b)
		\gll sacar las castañas del fuego \\
		{take out} the chestnuts {from the} fire\\
		\trans lit: pull the chestnust from the fire. idm: help somebody

		\ex\label{yet-another-label-c} % subenvironment (2.c)
		\gll estirar la pata \\
		stretch the leg\\
		\trans lit: stretch the leg. idm: die

	\end{xlist} % end first embedding

\end{exe}
```


My favorite idiom is (\ref{yet-another-label-c}) because because it is known everywhere in the Spanish-speaking world!

## Trees

The last thing we will practice is making syntactic trees. Tree drawing also requires a LaTeX environment and the package `forest`. You basically need to write your tree in bracket notation. The most basic tree I can think of is something like \@ref(fig:tree-00).  

```{r , tree-00, fig.align='center', out.width="1.5in", fig.cap="Simple tree", fig.pos="H"}
include_graphics("images/simple_tree.png")
```

Here's a simple trick I use to help me build them as quickly as possible.

    [XP 
    [Spec][X' 
          [X][YP]]]

```{=tex}
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{tree-01}
  \hfil
  \begin{forest}
    [XP 
    [Spec][X' 
          [X][YP]]]
  \end{forest}
\end{exe}
```

And there is our tree! All the things you can do with LaTeX, you can do here since it is a TeX environment! If you want to take a deep dive, check the [Forest package](https://texdoc.org/serve/forest/0)

You can, for instance, show movement with arrows. That would require you to label the _from_ and _to_ nodes using the `name` option. Then you'll have to actually draw the arrow using the command `\draw`. OJO! `\commands` need to end with a semicolon. They wont `knit` otherwise!

    [XP 
    [Spec, name=spec][X' 
    [X][YP, name=complement]]]
    \draw[->, dotted] (complement) to (spec);
    
```{=tex}
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{tree-02}
  \hfil
  \begin{forest}
    [XP 
    [Spec, name=spec][X' 
    [X][YP, name=complement]]]
    \draw[->, dotted] (complement) to (spec);
  \end{forest}
\end{exe}
```

That arrow looks wonky, but that is exactly what we asked `Forest` to draw; arrows always flight straight! To tweak the exit and entry points of the arrows, we need to use some basic cartography terminology! Check Figure \@ref(fig:compass) below:


```{r, compass, fig.align='center', out.width="1.5in", fig.cap="compass", fig.pos="H"}

include_graphics("images/compass.png")

```


Putting it all together, we need to tell the direction we want the arrow to exit the _from_ node and the direction we want the arrow to arrive at the _to_ node. 

    [XP 
    [Spec, name=spec][X' 
    [X][YP, name=complement]]]
    \draw[->, dotted] (complement) to[out=south west, in=south] (spec);


```{=tex}
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{tree-03}
  \hfil
  \begin{forest}
    [XP 
    [Spec, name=spec][X' 
    [X][YP, name=complement]]]
    \draw[->, dotted] (complement) to[out=south west, in=south] (spec);
  \end{forest}
\end{exe}
```

### Exercise -drawing trees
 
Draw a simple syntactic tree where you use a solid arrow to represent a Spec-head relationship. (3 minutes)

# A few more tricks

- include this in your YAML for latest version information:  
    - Last Updated: ` r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`.  
- You can use backslash LaTeX command liberally through our your document. For instance, our document would look better if we insert a couple of page breaks after the table of contents and before the references. I like the first line of the paragraph indented. 
    - `\FlushLeft`
    - `\newpage`
    - `\setlength\parindent{24pt}`
- You can label your sections for cross referencing. You can also keep sections from being numbered in  the the Table of Content, great for References and Appendices by labeling it with a minus sign. Check out section \ref{a-few-more-tricks}.
- Consider using Git and Github with your R project. It's the second best thing I have learned. Check https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html.
- RMarkdown lets you create more than just pdfs: my personal website is done with `blogdown`. I make my  classroom slides `xaringan`. Check [erwinlares.com](erwinlares.com)!
- If you couldn't finish all the things we did today, you can download a copy of the completed document we worked on today here: https://go.wisc.edu/t50wme
- Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, need help or want to collaborate on a cool linguistic project! lares@wisc.edu!
- Your headings don't work? Make sure there is a space between the hashtag and the text of your heading.
- Did you notice that because the trees we drew have labels? we can cross reference them!
- R for Data Science is a great resource. It is also free at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/. 
- I check this book all the time when I have RMarkdown questions: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/.
